<h1>On The Consumption of Beef</h1>
<p><strong>Minh Tran</strong> 05/08/2024</p>
<p>When I started my project, my Dad was quite indifferent to the project. He doesn’t see climate change as a big problem and so he did not care much about the change in my breakfast from steak to noodles and bread. My mom however was interested in my plan, and, she asked me how it went every day. She has been exposed to a lot more information about global warming, sustainability, and climate change, so I thought that is the main reason why she encouraged my project plan. However, my mom also presented me with a very impactful perspective, which really made me change my mind about how I saw food as a whole, and I have developed a new mindset about eating food which I will get into in a bit.</p>
<p>To begin the project, the biggest weakness in my solution design plan was that I hadn’t thoroughly planned out what I would replace steak breakfasts with, so I was unsure of what I was going to eat each day without beef. Second, I didn't schedule a clear start date and only began the project on April 29, which made me finish my reflections one day late for submission. Despite this problem, I still pushed on with the project and found some interesting things. In the future, I think it is important to plan out my meals the day before in order to prepare for school faster and make sure I have something to eat for breakfast.</p>
<p>I discovered that I was actually spending a lot on food relative to everyone else. Of course, before that, I knew that my food expenses were, well, expensive, but I didn’t fully grasp truly how much I was spending. For instance, a usual 6 oz. sirloin costs around $16, an amount others would usually take a week to spend. By switching to bread for breakfast, I saved approximately $14 daily, which could be up to $2520 over a school year. I find this interesting because the money saved represents an opportunity cost that can be allocated to more important things like the latest technology or dual enrollment.</p>
<p>Preparing simpler breakfasts like bread and fruit also allowed me to get ready for school faster. I actually realised that I wasn’t really enjoying my steak meals as much because I’m always rushing the meal to get to school. I was also eating it far too often, which I think diminishes the satisfaction of the meals as it feels a bit repetitive. In a way, eating less beef actually made it better on the weekends.</p>
<p>I think that it is evident that avoiding beef helps conserve our planet's natural resources by reducing the water footprint associated with beef production. According to Deutsche Welle, my favourite German broadcast, consuming one kilogram (35.274 oz) of beef generates methane and CO2 emissions equivalent to 99.48 kilograms of CO2. In other words, about every 5 steak breakfasts or about each week, I generate about as much as an average adult and a kid combined by weight in emissions. This is a staggering amount, which I wish to reduce as much as possible. Really, this was the main goal of the project besides everything else. An interesting observation I made was that Publix uses paper wrappers to package bread, instead of plastic. This led me to realise that avoiding certain packaging could reduce my plastic pollution significantly. In light of these observations, I have three lifestyle changes that I can commit to long term that would not only improve my life but also the environment.</p>
<p>Avoid eating beef every single day, reserving consumption of it for weekends only. My project has proven that it is possible to do this and also improve my relationship with beef as well, so there are practically no disadvantages to implementing this. It’s good for the environment, my mental and physical health, and my finances.</p>
<p>I should be aware of the packaging of the food products I purchase. By simply sticking to eating bread for about 4 days, I have reduced my plastic waste by a lot, and I think it is something easy I can stick to that helps the environment.</p>
<p>Finally, a crucial lifestyle change I can implement is to eat food more mindfully. This applies to all foods really. I think it is necessary to find time to simply sit down and truly appreciate and be thankful for the food I have, regardless of what it is. Remember when I said my mom changed my mindset? She told me that I was someone who was born and raised in the “upper-class” in Vietnam, and I never really acknowledged that there were people in the same country who couldn’t have enjoyed the things I had, and they were thankful for every meal they had. In fact, many didn’t know where their next meal would come from.</p>
<p>I think that my problem with beef isn’t just an environmental issue, but it also reveals a mental problem. My relationship with food is problematic, as I tend to judge it rather than enjoy it. This attitude has led me to some terrible food choices, which in the case of beef, has been detrimental to the environment and also my finances and health. This summer, I plan to dedicate at least 30 minutes to each meal, regardless of what it is, so that I can truly enjoy and be thankful for the food I have.</p>
<p>It is to this end that I think that it is also important to consider the global impact of collective consumption patterns, especially in terms of resource depletion and environmental degradation, as it relates to our relationship with the environment that is not a resource, for it is a part of humanity, yet it is still subject to the forces of exploitation and depletion.</p>
<p>Human population growth and resource consumption have led to over-exploitation of natural resources. While technology has improved living standards, they have also posed significant threats to biodiversity and nutrient cycles. Tropical deforestation occurs at a rate of about 15 million hectares per year, significantly contributing to species loss (Biller, 2018). Moreover, increasing food demands have seen a lot of monoculture crops, particularly in the United States, leading to a reduction in soil fertility and negatively impacting nutrient cycles.</p>
<p>Dilys Roe et al., in "Biodiversity Loss is a Development Issue," add that the global biodiversity crisis is exacerbated by monoculture farming, which leads to genetic erosion and a decline in crop diversity (Roe et al., 2019). Modern farming technologies also often rely on synthetic fertilisers and pesticides, which degrade soil biodiversity and disrupt natural nutrient cycles. The excessive use of nitrogen-based fertilisers has led to nutrient imbalances in many agricultural regions, resulting in soil degradation and eutrophication in nearby water bodies. Many places around the world are also experiencing desertification from over-farming.</p>
<p>There are solutions to these problems, fortunately. Sustainable development practices, such as agroforestry and biodiversity-friendly farming, can help restore biodiversity and maintain nutrient cycles. In addition, reducing beef consumption can certainly alleviate the pressure on land resources, reduce deforestation rates, and conserve biodiversity hotspots.</p>
<p>Biller suggests that implementing policies to reduce biodiversity loss and promote sustainable resource use can have significant economic benefits, with a focus on eliminating perverse incentives that encourage unsustainable practices. Roe et al. supports conservation approaches that empower local communities. For instance, Indigenous and traditional knowledge in maintaining biodiversity can be crucial in combating the problem. Here in the state of Georgia, we have the Creek and Sequoyah tribes, which know farming methods such as companion planting and crop rotation.</p>
