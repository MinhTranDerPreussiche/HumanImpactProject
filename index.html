        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Beef consumption is one of the leading causes of greenhouse gas emissions in the food industry.
            The Human Impact Project is my personal effort to reduce my environmental footprint by cutting down on beef consumption and finding more sustainable alternatives. With the help of a carbon footprint calculator, I track my emissions and reflect daily on my journey.

            Here's how it went:

        <div class="daily-content">
            <h2>Day 1</h2>
            <p>The bread from walmart wasn't very good. It sufficed for the day but I needed better bread. I'm glad I started at least. I did miss the steak a bit but it wasn't that big of a deal.</p>

    <section id="reflection-day-2" class="reflection-slide day-2">
        <div class="daily-content">
            <h2>Day 2</h2>
            <p>I made udon for breakfast. This is my favourite korean noodles, and ate it many times during these 10 days. I was actually happy to eat the noodles without the beef inside for one day, because I got to taste the original flavour again, which I hadn't done in a while.</p>
            <a href="#reflection-day-3" class="next-slide">Next Day</a>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section id="reflection-day-3" class="reflection-slide day-3">
        <div class="daily-content">
            <h2>Day 3</h2>
            <p>I really tried not eating beef today. Mr Leboeuf really tempted me. His name made itself me think of putting beef in my udon noodles, no disrespect to him! He said we should take in a lot of protein for the test, so I felt I had a good excuse to avoid it. In the end, I didn't put beef in my udon, but it was tempting.</p>
            <a href="#reflection-day-4" class="next-slide">Next Day</a>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section id="reflection-day-4" class="reflection-slide day-4">
        <div class="daily-content">
            <h2>Day 4</h2>
            <p>I ran out of udon noodles. Luckily my dad bought the bread I needed eat for breakfast the day before. I have to say, the publix bread is much better than at walmart. They also seemed to package it in paper bags which I think helps the environment a bit, compared to the plastic walmart packaging. The bread was only around two dollars, which was far cheaper than seven dollars for an 8oz sirloin.</p>
            <a href="#reflection-day-5" class="next-slide">Next Day</a>

    </section>

    <section id="reflection-day-5" class="reflection-slide day-5">
        <div class="daily-content">
            <h2>Day 5</h2>
            <p>My stepmom went shopping yesterday and I asked her to buy me some udon, but they actually ran out. The udon I eat is from korea, so its shipped in limited amounts. She bought me two instant bowl noodles. I ate the chicken flavoured one today, nothing remarkable. The hardest part so far was on Wednesday, but other than that, the main difficulty wasn't avoiding beef but just making sure that there were alternatives.</p>
            <a href="#reflection-day-6" class="next-slide">Next Day</a>

    <section id="reflection-day-6" class="reflection-slide day-6">
        <div class="daily-content">
            <h2>Day 6</h2>
            <p>I didn't eat beef today. Just business as usual. My stepmom bought udon over the weekend, so that's what I ate. I tried adding an egg on of the udon (yolk removed from the yellow part), that tasted good. Came to school a bit late because I had to finish my food. I played minecraft yesterday night.</p>
            <a href="#reflection-day-7" class="next-slide">Next Day</a>

    <section id="reflection-day-7" class="reflection-slide day-7">
        <div class="daily-content">
            <h2>Day 7</h2>
            <p>IT'S 8:20 AM and I barely left home. I'm writing this on my car right now. Anyways, I probably won't have breakfast this morning. I got milk though that was fine. At least I didn't eat steak though!</p>
            <a href="#reflection-day-8" class="next-slide">Next Day</a>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section id="reflection-day-8" class="reflection-slide day-8">
        <div class="daily-content">
            <h2>Day 8</h2>
            <p>The bread is expiring tomorrow, so I might only be able to finish three out of four of the bread I bought in total. Today I tried out full grain bread. It wasn't totally unfamiliar to me but it felt unusual. Unlike the two other bread types this one didn't taste good air fried. Maybe I need to cook this a bit differently. Also, because the bread was very dense, I only finished half of it when I got to school.</p>

    <section id="reflection-day-9" class="reflection-slide day-9">
        <div class="daily-content">
            <h2>Day 9</h2>
            <p>Today I ate the other half of the leftover bread from yesterday and the last bread I left for my stepmom to make a meal for lunch at home for my younger brothers. I don't really like full grain bread, so I probably will avoid it in the future.</p>
            <a href="#reflection-day-10" class="next-slide">Next Day</a>

            <h2>Day 10</h2>
            <p>Done! Today I ate udon for breakfast, taking a break from the bread. Overall, this project wasn't hard at all. The difficult part was actually documenting it because I would always forget to take a picture of the food.</p>
