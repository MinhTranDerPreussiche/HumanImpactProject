        <h1>Hi, I'm Minh</h1>
        <p>I stopped eating beef for breakfast for 10 days to reduce my carbon footprint. </br> Here's how I did it:</p>

        <h2>Day 1 Breakfast</h2>
        <p>On the first day, I ate Hawaiian bread for breakfast. It was quite simple, and it helped me get to school quickly because I didn't need to prepare much. I still came late though.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="daily" id="day2">
        <img src="./images/udon1.jpeg" alt="placeholder" class="dailyimg">
        <h2>Day 2 Breakfast</h2>
        <p>This morning, I made Udon noodles. But this time was special, I removed the beef from the recipe, and it still tastes good.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="daily" id="day3">
        <img src="./images/udon3.jpeg" alt="placeholder" class="dailyimg">
        <h2>Day 3 Breakfast</h2>
        <p>I made Udon for breakfast again.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="daily" id="day4">
        <img src="./images/udon2.jpeg" alt="placeholder" class="dailyimg">
        <h2>Day 4 Breakfast</h2>
        <p>Yep. You guessed it, more Udon. I also added an egg on top! I think that even without the beef, the egg definitely brought in a lot more flavour to spice things up a bit. I'm done with Udon for now.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="daily" id="day5">
        <img src="./images/softbread.jpeg" alt="placeholder" class="dailyimg">
        <h2>Day 5 Breakfast</h2>
        <p>This is some bread from publix. I bought it at their "deli" and I think it tastes pretty good. I air fried it for 5 minutes with the heat dial at two hours.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="daily" id="day6">
        <img src="./images/chickennoddlescooked.jpeg" alt="placeholder" class="dailyimg">
        <h2>Day 6 Breakfast</h2>
        <p>I ate some chicken instant noodles today. I remember it was actually pretty good for how easy it was to make. I wouldn't eat this everyday though.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="daily" id="day7">
        <img src="./images/walnutbread.jpeg" alt="placeholder" class="dailyimg">
        <h2>Day 7 Breakfast</h2>
        <p>I ate more bread today, but tried a different type, walnut. I was in a bit of a rush so I didn't remember air frying it that day. I shared it with my Dad on the car ride to school</p>

    <div class="daily" id="day8">
        <img src="./images/latepass.jpeg" alt="placeholder" class="dailyimg">
        <h2>Day 8...</h2>
        <p>No breakfast... I woke up too late!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="daily" id="day9">
        <img src="./images/thickbread.jpeg" alt="placeholder" class="dailyimg">
        <h2>Day 9 Breakfast</h2>
        <p>I tried whole grain bread and didn't really like it. It was very hard, perhaps I air fried it too long.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="daily" id="day10">
        <img src="./images/pandan.jpeg" alt="placeholder" class="dailyimg">
        <h2>Day 10 Breakfast</h2>
        <p>Something interesting today. My mother made a vietnamese jelly snack, I didn't really like it but I'm glad I tried it out.</p>
